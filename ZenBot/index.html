  ZenBot© was founded in 2023 by MXB (also known as Maxim Bogdan).
  First it was a simple bot with simple commands like /hey which responded with "Hi!" or /ping which responded with "Pong!".
  <br>
  After a couple months it was able to do simple calculations like adding (with /add), subtracting (with /subtract),
  multiplication (with/multiply), division (with /divide) and even powers (with /pow).
  <br>
  Soon it will be able to make embeds, <button class="preffered-button" style="padding: .2rem .5rem">button roles</button>,
  and many other
  <br>
  <!---->
  It was created with the

  <abbr title="Integrated Developer Environment" style="text-decoration: none;">IDE</abbr> 
  using the

  in JavaScript.
